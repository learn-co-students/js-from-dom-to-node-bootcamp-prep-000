          # Moving Away from the DOM

Congratulations! You are now able to understand how Javascript interacts with websites through the DOM. That's a big deal. Take a few seconds, breathe in, breath out and realize that you now know something you didn't before. Only a few lessons ago, you didn't even know what the DOM was. Now you understand how to manipulate it.

If you ever want to show your friends something cool, open up the console on any web page and then find the selector for an element, then modify it using
Javascript in the console. Prepare to enjoy the shock and awe of your friends!

## From DOM Manipulation to Programming Logic

For the rest of this material, we will be moving from the basics of DOM manipulation to the meat and potatoes of programming. This means we are going to cover the ideas of conditionals, looping, encapsulation and syntax. I know those may not be familiar to you, but over the next few lessons they will become second nature! Remember when DOM was a scary word? Encapsulation will soon go the way of the DOM. You're going to be encapsulating everything.

Really the goal of the rest of this course is to introduce you to _programmatic thinking_. We will be doing that through explaining Javascript, but the goal of every student we serve at The Flatiron School is to teach programmatic thinking as a general way to solve problems. These problems may be creating the next Facebook, or it may be just solving the best order to complete your errands. You'll notice programmatic, logical thinking starting to permeate throughout your decision process. It's incredibly powerful and something that has aided millions of programmers to solve some of the hardest problems in the world. 

That is the goal with this class. While we may touch on making pictures of cats spin, we want you to internalize the thought process required to solve that silly problem. Hopefully, you'll go off after this class and solve some slightly more important problems :)

### Javascript Outside of the Browser

You've spent some time in the browser with Javascript. That's great. Now let's get to where Javascript has been rapidly increasing its programming market share: outside of the browser. You may have heard of it, but a new tool called NodeJS was created a few years back to allow developers to write Javascript code outside of the browser. That is what we are going to use now to be able to go deep on programmatic thinking, without having to explain complicated browser interactions. We want to simplify programming down to its most core elements. 

### Hello World

Let's write your first code using NodeJS and non-browser Javascript. To do this, we are going to remove your first set of training wheels. We are no longer going to be using the CodePens that we've been using before. We are going to use a real developer environment through the Learn IDE.

![Training Wheels](https://web-dev-readme-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/js/training_wheels.gif)

To launch the Learn IDE, click the blue Open button at the top of this page. This should download the lesson to your IDE and open the IDE. If you need to re-download the IDE, you can do so [here](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/how-to-download-and-use-learn-ide-3).

Now open the "js-from-dom-to-node" folder on the left folder viewer pane and then select the file `index.js`. IT'S CODING TIME.

First thing is first, I want to show you that everything we will do in the IDE, you can do in the Console. First, return to your browser, right click and select Inspect. Then make sure the Console is selected and type `console.log("Hello, World!")` and press Enter. You should see "Hello, World!" printed right below your line of code. Congrats! You just wrote your first line of browser-less code. All this does is print out whatever is in between the parenthesis.

Let's bring that code over to our `index.js` file on the IDE. Make sure you are in the `index.js` file in the `js-from-dom-to-node` folder. Once in there go ahead and paste the following code in there:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!")
```

Now when you hit Enter, nothing super interesting will happen. All that occurs is the cursor moves to a new line. That's because you are in the text editor. This is pretty much the same as using Word. To get this to actually return something like we did in the Console in the browser we need to _execute_ the `index.js` file. It sounds super official, but all we are going to do is tell the IDE "I'm ready, run this code and show me the result".

First, we have to **save the file**. Next, look at the pane at the bottom of the IDE. This is your terminal. Below your code you should see a flashing cursor like this:

![command line in ide](https://web-dev-readme-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/js/ide-command-line.png)

Alright, let's let the magic happen! First, we need to make sure we are in the right folder. Our goal is to make it into the "js-from-dom-to-node" folder. If you look at the text next to the time, you should see `js-from-dom-to-node` or something very similar. If you see that, you are good and you can skip the next section. If it says something else, follow these instructions:

If you see `code`, we need to go into our `labs` folder first. To do this type `cd labs`. Now if should see `labs` next to the clock. We have to go one more folder in. I know this by looking at the folder structure on the left. See how `labs` is in `code` and `js-from-dom-to-node` is in labs? Ok now we need to `cd` into the `js-from-dom-to-node` lab. Take a look at your folder structure on the right to get the _exact_ name and then type `cd EXACT-FOLDER-YOU-WANT-TO-ENTER`. In my case, I get `js-from-dom-to-node`. If you were successful, you'll see `js-from-dom-to-node` next to the clock.

To run your code, you can type `nodejs index.js`. `nodejs` is the node code runner and `index.js` is the name of your file. You should see:

```
Hello, World!
```

Woot! It worked. You just wrote your first Javascript outside of the browser. Now let's submit it back to Learn. In your terminal type `learn submit`. This will send your code up to Learn and you may move on to the next lesson. 

#### Possible Errors

After you type in `nodejs index.js` you get something looks like:

```
module.js:471

Error: Cannot find module '/home/jmburges/code/labs/index.js'                                                                 
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:469:15)

    at run (bootstrap_node.js:393:7)                                                                                          
    at startup (bootstrap_node.js:150:9)                                                                                      
    at bootstrap_node.js:508:3                                                                                                
```

The key there is "Error: Cannot find module". That just means you are in the wrong folder. Go back and read the earlier paragraph that starts "If you see `code`...". That should help you out. You need to be seeing `js-from-dom-to-node` next to the clock.
